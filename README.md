## Hi there, I'm Thitipong 👋

### Aspiring Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) & Backend Developer
**Student at Faculty of Engineering (CEDT), Chulalongkorn University**

I'm a first-year Computer Engineering student passionate about the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Infrastructure**. My goal is not just to write code that works, but to build systems that are **reliable, scalable and efficient**.

---

### About Me
I'm currently working on building **High-Performance Web Servers** using **Go (Fiber & net/http)**. <br>
I'm deeply learning about **Linux Internals, System Architecture** and **Computer Networking**. <br>
My goal : To master **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and become a specialist in **Data Center Operations & Cloud Computing**. <br>
Fun fact : I prefer the **Terminal** over GUI, and I believe in automation over manual toil.
